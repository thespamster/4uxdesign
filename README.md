# 4uxdesign.com Website & CV

![](assets/img/img_4uxdesign.webp)

** This site has been archived and a new site is being designed **

A substantial redesign has changed the site layout from a 2 page site to a  single page.
The banner has been removed and replaced with a large colour background image.
The layout now has a cookie banner that fades on scroll revealing the main menu behind.
My portfolio is now on the same page and has had a subtle redesign with slim borders
providing better separation between projects.
My downloadable CV has been moved to the bottom of the 'about me' modal improving the
look of the main page.
Apple maps has replaced Open Street Maps, the image used is clearer and changes from b&w 
to colour on hover.
The EmailJS service has been updated both in the backend to support a new email address and
the javascript has been rewritten to improve the code. The service now uses an event
listener rather than the inline onSubmit command and the way the form details are handled
has been streamlined.
Bootstrap5.3 is provided through downloaded source files
